 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    HandyAstro is a collection of miscellaneous programs, shell scripts, and anything
    else really, that I've created and used in my astronomy wanderings.

 CONTENTS
 --------
    avi_to_seq:

    This is a shell script to convert an 'avi' file to a sequence of images. This is 
    sometimes useful for processing astro images as individual images rather than 
    from a video file. It may give improved results.

    Note that 'avi_to_seq' is little more than a convenient shortcut frontend to the 
    'ffmpeg' command line tool, which is also free software.
    See https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html for details. It may also be necessary to install
    'ffmpeg'. (Hint: Ubuntu - use 'sudo apt-get install ffmpeg').

    While I have used this for the purpose described, it has NOT been extensively tested
    and may contain bugs or shortcomings.
