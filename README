 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    HandyAstro is a collection of miscellaneous programs, shell scripts, and anything
    else really, that I've created and used in my astronmy wanderings.

 CONTENTS
 --------
    avi_to_seq:

    This is a shell script to convert an 'avi' file to a sequence of images. This is 
    sometimes useful for processing astro images from individual images rather than 
    from a video file. It may give improved results.

    Note that it uses the 'ffmpeg' command line tool. This is free software.
    See https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html for details. It may be necessary to install
    this. (Hint: Ubuntu - use 'sudo apt-get install ffmpeg').

    While I have used this for the purpose described, it has NOT been extensively tested
    and may contain bugs or shortcomings.
